# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool for visualizing graph algorithms including:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree

## Features
- Interactive graph creation and editing
- Real-time algorithm visualization
- Step-by-step algorithm progress display
- Edge weight modification
- Multiple algorithm support

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask server: `python app.py`
4. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
5. Or, use docker.

## Usage
1. Add nodes by clicking the "Add Node" button
2. Create edges by entering source and target nodes with weights
3. Select an algorithm and starting node
4. Run the algorithm to see the visualization
